Developed an online movie ticket booking system application using JavaFX. Designed and implemented
an intuitive user interface that allows users to browse available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets seamlessly.
Integrated API calls to fetch real-time movie data and seat availability. Implemented secure user authentication
and payment gateway integration to ensure a smooth and secure booking experience. This project showcased my
proficiency in Java programming, user interface design, and API integration, along with the ability to create a
functional and user-friendly application.
